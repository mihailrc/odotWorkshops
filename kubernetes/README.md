## Microservices, Docker, Kubernetes

#### Story

10 years ago you were tasked with writing a web application that performs sentiment analysis. This application takes as input one sentence and says whether the sentence is saying something positive or something negative. Back then everybody was building traditional server side MVC applications so you did the same thing and picked Spring MVC to develop the application.

Fast forward 5 years and now everybody builds Single Page Web applications and obviously want their applications to look good on Mobile Devices. So how do you adapt to this new world? Well ... you can still use Spring MVC for the back end but now the functionality needs to be exposed via REST endpoints instead of serving HTML content. These REST endpoints are in turn used by your new shiny React Front end, that uses Bootstrap to handle Responsive Web Design.

Fast forward another 2 years and now every problem is a Machine Learning problem so everybody needs to use ML or DL to look cool. The challenge is that that you need to use Python to benefit from the best ML libraries. Now the application has JavaScript on the front end, Java on the Web serving layer and Python on the back end. The application evolved from using Java across the entire stack to using 3 distinct technologies maintained by 3 teams working across 3 different continents. Now you need to figure out how to develop and deploy these components independently.

Because of the new Machine Learning library the application became an instant success and you need to scale it. From an initial benchmarking it seems that sentiment analysis has the highest load while the Web serving component experiences medium load. Also it turns out the application cannot have downtime anymore because that translates into lost revenue. So you need to figure out how to scale each of these components independently with zero downtime.

These are the problems that we will try to solve during this workshop.

#### Goals
In this workshop we are going to learn about the following:
* Why do we need micro-services?
  * problems they solve
  * problems they create
* Docker Containers
  * how they relate to micro-services
  * basics of Docker and Docker files
* Container orchestration with Kubernetes
  * why Kubernetes  
  * scaling micro-services independently
  * zero downtime deployments

### Prerequisites
To follow along in this workshop the following have to be installed
* git
* Docker Machine
* Minikube

#### Chapter 0
Now the saga begins ...

I am not going to bore you with creating an MVC application. As a starting point we are going to use an application that is already split into 3 components. For most of this workshop I am going to follow this [excellent introduction to Kubernetes](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/learn-kubernetes-in-under-3-hours-a-detailed-guide-to-orchestrating-containers-114ff420e882)

Download the following repository

```
git clone https://github.com/rinormaloku/k8s-mastery.git
```

The application consists of 3 components
* SA-Frontend serves React JS files
* SA-WebApp handles request from front end
* SA-Logic performs sentiment analysis

#### [Chapter 1 - Setting up the development environment](labs/lab1-devSetup/README.md)
This explains why it is beneficial to set up a development environment based on Docker Containers
#### [Chapter 2 - Docker - It's all about containers](labs/lab2-containers/README.md)
This explains how to build the application components as Docker images
#### [Chapter 3 - Docker Compose - Running multi container applications locally](labs/lab3-dockerCompose/README.md)
This introduces Docker Compose and show how to improve the experience of running an application that consists of multiple Docker containers
#### [Chapter 4 - Kubernetes Basics - Container Orchestration](labs/lab4-pods/README.md)
This introduces Kubernetes, what problem it solves and explains some basic concepts
#### [Chapter 5 - Kubernetes Services - Reliability and Fault Tolerance](labs/lab5-services/README.md)
This introduces Kubernetes Services and Load Balancers.
#### [Chapter 6 - Kubernetes Deployments - Scaling and Reliable Deployments](labs/lab6-deployments/README.md)
This introduces Kubernetes Deployments and show how to Scale the application, handle application updates with Zero Downtime deploys and rolling back to a previous version if things go wrong.
#### [Chapter 7 - Ingress controllers - Access from the Outside](labs/lab7-ingress/README.md)
Making Kubernetes services available from the outside
